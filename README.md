#  Custom CNN Image Classification

This project implements and compares three convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for image classification:

- **Custom-built CNN** (from scratch)
- **VGG16** (transfer learning)
- **AlexNet** (transfer learning)

All models are implemented in **PyTorch** and trained on a dataset with **19 image classes**.
