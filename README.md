# -Custom-CNN-for-Image-classification
This project implements and compares three convolutional neural network architectures for image classification: a custom-built CNN, VGG16 (transfer learning), and AlexNet (transfer learning). It is built using PyTorch and trained on a dataset with 19 image classes.
