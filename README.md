# Custom-CNN-for-Image-classification
This project compares three convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for image classification:
Custom-built CNN (from scratch)
VGG16 (transfer learning)
AlexNet (transfer learning)

All models are implemented in PyTorch and trained on a dataset with 19 image classes.
